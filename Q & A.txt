Project 11

You are given a project from a client. The client wants you to create a banking system. Here is what your program needs to do:

1. Allow a customer to deposit/withdraw/transfer and check the balance of their account.

To help you get started, here is a skeleton class:
class Account
  #should keep track of the customers name, their balance 
  #and you should create methods to allow for 
  #deposit, withdrawal and transferring of funds
end

a = Account.new
a.account_holder = ‘Steve’ 
a.deposit 100
puts a.balance #should print 100

a.withdraw 25
puts a.balance #should print 75

b = Account.new
b.account_holder = ‘Jeron’
b.deposit 4000
puts b.balance #should print 4000

Account.transfer(50, a, b)  #What we are saying here is I want to transfer 50 from a to b
puts a.balance #should print 25
puts b.balance #should print 4025
